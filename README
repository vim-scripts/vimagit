Outstanding features

* See all your changes, staged changes, untracked/removed/renamed files in one unique buffer.
* Staged/unstaged/discard changes with one key press, moving the cursor around. Stage at hunk or file level. Line and partial line staging are ongoing.
* Start to write the commit message in one key press, commit also in one key press.
* Visualize stashes. Apply, pop, drop are on going.
* Add file to .gitignore file.

More to come:

* Line and partial line staging.
* Vizualize and checkout branches.
* Go through history, cherry-pick changes.

    Why should I use vimagit, there are already plethora git plugins for vim?

* fugitive is a very complete plugin, with a lot of functions. I use it for years, and it is a fundamental tool in my workflow. But visualize your changes and staged them in broad number of files is really a pain.
* vim-gitgutter is very well integrated into vim, but without the ability to commit stages, it stays an informational plugin.
